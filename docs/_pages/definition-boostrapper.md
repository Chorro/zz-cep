The bootstrapper is the mechanism that is used to load stream config into cep. You can configure the boostrapper class on the config file, using `bootstrapper.classname` property. Currently, the cep has two bootstrappers:

* [FileBootstrapper](https://wizzie.io/zz-cep/bootstrapper/file-boostrapper.html)
* [KafkaBootstrapper](https://wizzie.io/zz-cep/bootstrapper/kafka-boostrapper.html)
